  <p>Hello! My name is Elliot McGonigal. I am a student enrolled at Epicodus. I have worked through part of this course before and quite enjoyed it. I am looking forward to seeing it through this time. These are some of my favorite works from my time at Epicodus so far!</p>
  <a href="https://github.com/ElliotMcGonigal/pig-dice">Pig Dice Game</a>
  <p>This was a project I worked that played a game called Pig Dice. We used javascript and jquery for the funtionality of the game, and css to display it all. I learned a lot during this project.</p>
