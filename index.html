  <h1>Elliot McGonigal</h1>
  <img src="img/Elliot.jpg" alt="Elliot">
  <p>Hello! My name is Elliot McGonigal. I am a student enrolled at Epicodus. I have worked through part of this course before and quite enjoyed it. I am looking forward to seeing it through this time. These are some of my favorite works from my time at Epicodus so far!</p>
  <a href="https://github.com/ElliotMcGonigal/pig-dice">Pig Dice Game</a>
  <p>This was a project I worked that played a game called Pig Dice. We used javascript and jquery for the funtionality of the game, and css to display it all. I learned a lot during this project.</p>
  <a href="https://github.com/ElliotMcGonigal/Roman-Numeral-Converter">Roman Numeral Converter</a>
  <p>This project was one I worked on when learning what the steps to testing and building up code were. We learned how to set up the tests and make sure our project was doing what it needs to do. Even though I remember running into <em>a lot</em> of struggles with this one, it was very fun and satisfying to finally break through and have it functional in the end.</p>
  <a href="https://github.com/ElliotMcGonigal/galactic-age">Galactic Age Calculator</a>
  <p>This was a project I worked on when learning Webpack and Node. It calculates what your age would be on other planets. It was crazy to begin to see how many usful tools there are for coding. I look forward to working with these tools and many more as I progress.</p>
